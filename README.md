Just me playing with different peripherals that came on a stm32f4 Discovery board
Hopefully it'll eventually become a working quadcopter

So far i have working:
   PWM (TIM4)
   I2C
   SPI
   TIM3 with Interrupt
   L3GD20(Gyroscope)
   LSM303DLH (Accelerometer and Magnetometer)
   Push button with a Interrupt
   Systick Timer
