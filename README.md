Just me playing with different peripherals that came on a stm32f4 Discovery board
Hopefully it'll eventually become a working quadcopter

   1. PWM (TIM4 4 channels)
   2. I2C
   3. SPI
   4. TIM3 with Interrupt
   5. L3GD20(Gyroscope)
   6. LSM303DLH (Accelerometer and Magnetometer)
   7. Push button with a Interrupt
   8. Systick Timer
